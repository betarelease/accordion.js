Simple Accordion(Prototype 1.6)
We got frustrated of using AccordionV2.0 because with Prototype1.6 it started rendering with really bad effects. So we wrote our own which was considerably simpler.

Here it is for all to use.

Look at the test file to know what kind of elements it supports.

More to come...
1) Horizontal accordion
2) Effects 
and more..
